# chrome_extensions

The start of a random Chrome extension collection

## had_demigrainefy

I read the Hack-a-Day website all the time but its white on black style gives me a migraine. Really, it makes me see a migraine aura and basically incapacitates all further reading until the symptoms pass. So this extension overrides a couple of key css styles to make the site more accessible for me.
